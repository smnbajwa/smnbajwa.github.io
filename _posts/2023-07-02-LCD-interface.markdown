title: Interface LCD1602 (based on Hitachi HD44780) using push buttons
---

**Objective**  
I came across this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn8ibFeVsoU) showing 
how to display text on LCD1602 without using a microcontroller. I wanted to do 
this because only using push buttons helps in low-level understanding of how the 
MCU actually sends data to the LCD.

Also, this was a good exercise on how to navigate [datasheets](https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/LCD/HD44780.pdf)
