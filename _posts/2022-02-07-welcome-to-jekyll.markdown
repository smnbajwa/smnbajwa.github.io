I wanted to learn more about electronics and programming so a friend suggested that I take on a project to see if I actually like doing the work.

I came across this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z26LVu5y0) on Youtube and wanted to build it for myself.

I must state that I had no experience in electronics and programming outside of Mechanical Engineering degree curriculum.

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
