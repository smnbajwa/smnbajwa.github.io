My name is Saman (pronounced suh.muhn) and I like to get to the bottom of things.<br>

As a child, I would take apart my toys to find out what's inside. This satisfied my curiosity in addition to frowning parents and one less toy as I could not put it back together.<br>

I can put things back together now so I guess that's growth?

On this website, I will documents my journey as I dabble in electronics, coding, and other technical enterprises.<br>

I am a Mechanical Engineering graduate from Punjab Technical University.<br>

In my free time, I like to read, cook, and practice Jiu Jitsu/Freestyle Wrestling.
