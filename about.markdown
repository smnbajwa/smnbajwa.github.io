This quote is the motivation behind this blog.

I am learning about Embedded systems, programming, and electronics.

Writing about what I have learned helps me understand it better and help others.

# Who am I?
My name is Saman Bajwa (pronounced like "summon" + "baaj-wah").

I have a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering, but I found sticking to one domain too limiting. I was fascinated by the intersection of mechanical engineering, electronics, and software. After a few years in mechanical design, I transitioned to embedded systems. Currently, I work on bare-metal real-time driver development for autonomous agriculture machines.
