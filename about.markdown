# Why this blog?

> What I cannot create, I do not understand.  
>                                - Richard Feynman

The above quote is the motivation behind this blog.

I have been learning about Embedded systems, programming, and electronics.

Writing about what I have learned helps me understand it better and maybe help others.

# Who am I?
My name is Saman.
A few things about me:

- I have played Counter-Strike semi-professionally (10k hours on my steam account)
- I use Lindy effect to make my decision making easier (tried and tested > latest fads)
